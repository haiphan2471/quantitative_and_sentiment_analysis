camwow13,"* Dynamic island

* 48MP Quad Bayer main cam

* Slightly updated design with rounded edges. Looks like they just hit the whole phone with sandpaper.

* New wideband chip for longer range

* USB C (at USB 2.0 speeds lol)

* Some new random pastel colors


Otherwise more or less identical to the iPhone 14. Same price as it too. Same processor as last year's pro 14, no new design, no faster screen, just quality of life updates. 

Phones have matured and stagnated and as a result, it is kinda boring. But it's understandable I suppose. 

It's arguable they're creating pretty artificial price barriers between the pro and regular models now though. Used to get the latest chip? Now only the pro gets the latest. Would be a piece of cake to add USB 3 or at least 90hz refresh, but nope only pro gets those! Can we put a button on the phone? Nope! Custom buttons are pro features. üòéTiTaNiUM oOoOO ahhh is cool I guess. Some slightly better cameras? Anyway I guess that's the most annoying part of it."

Look up  PWM and see how many people complain about this.

New-Monarchy,"Tossing my opinion in here.. ..I honestly think there isn't much reason to go Pro this year.

For a Max user like myself, I could care less about the slightly smaller bezels, slightly more optical zoom (base models now finally have 2x zoom), and transfer speeds.

The only noteworthy thing is that you only get 60Hz on base, which honestly is something I don't want to REWARD Apple with spending more on the Pro for. $400 Android phones get 90Hz adaptive screens at this point.

Base models now get the nice frosted back finish, they weigh much less, you save $300 compared to the Pro Max, and they tend to retain their value better."

PsychologicalGate539,The downfall of Apple. The whole point of the iPhone is that it‚Äôs ecosystem is different from the rest of the phones. The main reason young people buy iPhones is because they will be bullied or feel pressure if they don‚Äôt.

viperchrisz4,"Anyone catch that the non pro 15‚Äôs technically have farther zoom range than the 15 pro non max model? Since the main on the 15 was upped to 48mp it can digital zoom to a 12mp equivalent at ‚Äò4x‚Äô while the 15 pro is a 3x at 12mp lens. 

Even with optical zoom>digital zoom, the main sensors are much better with details in low light. You can test this now if you have a 14 pro/max. With the way the zoom is automated across the 3 cameras you are stuck with 2.9x as the max crop zoom on the main 48mp since it switches to the 12mp tele at 3x. 2.9x on the 48mp sometimes looks better and more detailed vs 3x on the telephoto. 

Considering the 15 doesn‚Äôt have a telephoto all zoom is done on the new 48mp sensor which gives you farther range at higher resolutions than the 15 pro telephoto would. 8x at 6mp equivalent on the 15 would be only 6x at 6mp on the 15 pro. Am I crazy or does this kind of make sense?"

Anyone know if the new ultrawide camera is in both pro models?    I assume the base model sees no upgrade there"

Future_Pin_403,If I upgrade my 11 it‚Äôs going to be for the pink 15 purely because it is pink. I loved my rose gold 6s

JustCallMeTsukasa-96,"There's just too much I hate about this. The fact that that USB-C port is actually official, the fact that all those colors are as bland as the color selection before it. That distracting as heck Dynamic Island! The bloody USB-C port! And don't get me started on them replacing the mute switch with the stupid Action Button! There's hardly anything here that I would consider to be actually good overall. Especially with eSIM still being a forced implementation here."

LegalDeseperado,Base IPhone is the new SE !
Luised2094,"Lmao, get USB-C, still has the same speed as a Lighthing. Lmao, can't be more obvious that is just a ""we have to change this port because the law makes me, but you still get stuck with our shit speed"" GG Apple, GG"
Dry_Damp,"Apple officially transitioned to USB-C in it‚Äôs phones and AirPods (Pro/Max) ‚Äî and going forward, probably all other products as well. Yay!!

However, the regular iPhone 15 will only support USB 2.0 (480 MBit/s) and not 3.1 (10 GBit/s) like the pro.

I think that‚Äôs quite disappointing and I don‚Äôt see a reason for this limitation ‚Äî it seems rather artificial. Is it really just to get people to buy the pro? I mean we‚Äôre talking about a ~20 year old standard (2.0; 3.0 was specified ~15 years ago). For a premium phone like the iPhone (that sells for a premium price of ~$1.000) I‚Äôd expected at least 3.0.

What do you think? Justified? Stupid?

*(To be clear: I think the 15 is a great phone but it‚Äôs also a little disappointing to finally have USB-C but with the limitations of 2.0. I guess charging speed is also a little disappointing but that‚Äôs not necessarily because of the 2.0/3.1-issue.)*"

The iOS updates are more interesting (and honestly have always been more interesting imo). But the iterative updates on the hardware are perfectly fine. My gf for example has an iPhone 8 and is going to be upgrading. The 15 is such a massive upgrade. Imagine coming from that to this phone."

FightOnForUsc,Which to me is weird because they could have done it years ago. It‚Äôs also weird because with Mac apple was the first to go all in on usb c. Even to the point of being ridiculed by many. But I think they didn‚Äôt want to lose out on the MFi money. Lightening also have some slight technical advantages from a port design since there‚Äôs not the little male piece inside the female end of the port that increases potential for breakage.

girl4life,we are at 15 not 23 and apple doesn't use ultra in their model naming. or I understand you wrong.
MrSh0wtime3,and you can argue the telephoto setup is actually work.   3x portraits are useful.   You no longer have that since its a fixed 5x zoom.  5x and above is rarely useful.  Even in national parks we rarely would have a situation where 10x framed a photo well.

BeautifulTale6351,its a shitty usb 2.0 port for the non-pro 15
Coridoras,"The EU specifically mentioned that said regulations are just as illegal as not using USB C at all. So while I don't have any proof, I doubt it.

Although the regular iPhone 15 has only USB 2.0, so it's besides compatibility not much better than lightning. Guess USB 3.0 was too expensive for a 799$ phone"

Took me about 1.5 months round and round with FedEx and Google to eventually get Google to ship a 2nd phone (me telling them ""I""m not paying $1000 for an empty box"".. and that they know the IMEI and etc information from the stolen phone, so they should be able to track where it ended up.

I'm only using the connector for charging so speed is irrelevant for me.  Sure, higher power delivery of USB 3 might be nice but is not a motivating factor for me."
ResidualSound,"The unit price difference between a 10 gigabit and 1 gigabit port is still significant. 2.0 to 3.2 is a pro feature unfortunately.

ETA:

My example was bad as it is based on gigabit Ethernet vs 10 gb Ethernet (most consumer devices such as routers and laptops are still using 1gb)

The cheapest 10Gb router I could find on Amazon was $500.

jayemmreddit,"Asking you hoping im asking someone who can help me: why would i as a person care one way or another about the data speed of the usb connection.

coding_ape,Which is against the EU regulation

el_Topo42,"If you wanna transfer 200 gigs of video to your MacBook, have a look at speed comparisons."

gigapumper,makes a massive difference. I was tight on money last year so sold my iphone for $500 and bought a cheap $200 samsung. it has 120hz display and it feels SO much better and smoother. Using a 60hz phone now feels like aids. I can never go back to 60hz.
Bieberkinz,"To me, it does make a difference (think PC/console gaming), but in this scenario, it doesn‚Äôt really matter as much on a smartphone. I‚Äôve been using a used budget Android phone (Nokia G400) just to mess around see how the UI feels and have it as a fidget customization device, while I can definitely see and feel the smoothness and responsiveness, going back to my main phone (iPhone XR), I can easily live with the trade off.

I classify high refresh rates on mobile devices a nice to have rather than a most have, but that‚Äôs just my take. I would imagine a large chunk of iPhone users are like me and only really use it as a consumption device, where a high refresh rate is cool but not as needed."

rnarkus,"Yes, that‚Äôs good. Apple was moving this way anyway.

Like I get the EU angle, but do you people really think apple was going to stay on lightning forever? When almost all their other products have moved on?"
masorick,"People also forget that MagSafe has been a thing for three years.

Why is that relevant? Because MagSafe being an option makes the transition to USB-C less painful: if you were relying on MagSafe to charge your phone, then you will not need to change your cables right away. Also, MagSafe has incentivized accessory makers not to rely so much on the Lightning port, so that the transition will be less painful for them as well.

I‚Äôm convinced that when they introduced MagSafe, Apple was already planning for the switch to USB-C."
rootbeerdan,"Well, nobody can unless they are willing to violate their NDA with Apple.

But it's pretty obvious they didn't want lightning to stick around, anyone else remember they had lighting on the iPad Pro for exactly 1 year? They saw the writing on the wall years ago, they basically relegated lightning to low power devices and made everything else USB-C."
SacRepublicFan,"Apple does something good like limiting packaging materials to reduce waste.

legopego5142,I agree it would be nice but i swear yall sound crazy talking about itüòÇ
EraYaN,At least the Pro has a good blue again
maximalsimplicity,I noticed that too. I really like the blue on the 13 and 12.
katze_sonne,"Oh yes, I love my 12 Pro blue. But the blue color on the 15 non-pro looks horrible. And tbh the 15 pro blue looks okay but doesn't sell me. The 12 Pro blue was perfect. Maybe going back to black again... *sigh*"
FastLine2,I want the 5C colors
bringbackswg,It‚Äôs Easter colors
WigginIII,Something tells me they went with a pastel color palette because it showed off the new colored glass best.
SACHD,"I kinda get the feeling that if they haven‚Äôt given the regular iPhones 90 Hz yet, they never will. They‚Äôll probably give the regular iPhones 120 Hz displays, when the Pros get 180/240 Hz."
IFuckedADog,"Yup. Whenever I get excited about a new monitor that can push 144hz, partner can‚Äôt tell. Can‚Äôt tell between 60hz and 120hz, can SOMETIMES tell between 30hz and 60, cannot tell between 24hz and 30hz

Most of us are nerds and obsess over these things. It‚Äôs fine, but it doesn‚Äôt matter to the large majority.

I for one love having 120hz on my iPhone and iPad. I feel like it‚Äôs one of those things where once you can notice it, it‚Äôs hard to go back."
TheAspiringFarmer,bingo.
morgadox40,"That‚Äôs crazy lol my wife is not tech savvy at all, but she did notice something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù on my 13 Pro screen‚Ä¶ she said it appeared faster."
Rulyhdien,"this is me. 

I once compared iphone 13 pro and the regular one side by side, and I really had to concentrate to tell the difference."
ripelivejam,"Hertz, don‚Äôt it?"
K14_Deploy,"You're absolutely right here. Some people cannot tell the difference (my dad is one of those people, he literally cannot tell the difference between 60hz and 120hz)."
nimsuc,"Lol I don‚Äôt even know what all of this means, so I guess I‚Äôm the target audience lol"
ArgoMium,"You really can't tell switching from 60hz to 144+hz monitors. I switched to a 144hz monitor after years of being stuck on a 60hz monitor and I didn't notice a big difference. Sure, it was slightly smoother, but nothing too crazy. You really notice it once you go from 144+ hz back down to 60hz. Scrolling on 60hz phones feel terrible since I made the switch to a 120hz display on my phone"
imaqdodger,It mostly depends what you are doing with the screen. I once didn't realize I had set my PC monitor to 60hz until I jumped into an FPS game. With general desktop usage I didn't notice the mouse was not moving as smoothly. Once I switched back to 144hz I could tell the difference on the desktop cursor but that was because I looking for it.
Pandabear71,"Thats how refresh rate works though. You really wont see a difference between 60 and 120 until it clicks. When it does, 60 feels incredibly slow. 30 is even worse. 
I litteraly cant play games on 30 because i feel like its all in slow motion."
y-c-c,Similar things happened to me and my dad. I recently just used his computer and to my horror found out that his monitor was 4K 30Hz because it's cheap and one of the HDMI ports didn't support new HDMI standards. I didn't know how it wouldn't have felt like crap (maybe it did but he diidn't know how to articulate it).
Snuhmeh,The geeks are going to complain forever. But you‚Äôre correct. The people who just want to use their phone throughout the day don‚Äôt care about refresh rate.
lospollosakhis,99% of people will look at you like üòØ when you mention these kinds of specs to them lol
threwmydate,Bro you could literally say that about any feature. The major iphone customer is the one who will just buy that shit for imessage and having the OS they are used to.
funkiestj,"count me in the ""don't care about refresh rate"" group."
Betancorea,That is such a suck up excuse
Kalahan7,"Man you can say the same about pretty much any feature they put in an iPhone. The average customer doesn't care about insane performance, or bionic engine, or that the camera this year takes slightly better photos in low light, yet they keep adding all these things.

Most consumers would probably still notice a difference between 60fps or 120fps though, just like they will notice all the above changes they supposedly ""don't care"" about. They might not understand exactly why but one device will feel smoother than the other. And that's the sort of thing Apple sells. 

The only reason why the base iPhone still is 60hz is because it's a major selling feature to get people to buy the Pro. Simple as that."
Blaze4G,Standard iPhone experience is a device that's smooth while operating it. Which a higher refresh rate will contribute to the smoothness.
4514919,">The customer who wants a standard iPhone experience doesn‚Äôt ~~care~~ have a choice about refresh rate.

FTFY


You can't claim that someone doesn't *want* something when he is not getting offered that something."
doublepoly123,well yeah... but the competition baseline phones offer better...
ProtoplanetaryNebula,"Yeah, I bet the percentage of people who have an iPhone who even know what a refresh rate is is surprisingly low."
mushiexl,"True but like come on, at least give us 90hz"
IdaDuck,"My wife is very smart and has an iPhone 13, and I guarantee she doesn‚Äôt even know what the term refresh rate means. It‚Äôs just not something she cares about at all."
,[deleted]
hm9408,"The customer will feel their phone is faster with a higher refresh rate, guaranteed.

They're cutting corners to maximize profit, don't say this  is customer driven lol"
DM_ME_PICKLES,When there are mid-range Androids with 120Hz for half the price there's really no excuse not to put 120Hz in the 15. It makes a noticeable difference to how smooth and snappy the phone feels.
Dravarden,"""the average consumer doesn't care""

they also don't care about retina displays, or OLED displays, or the taptic engine, or the more powerful cpu, or the hundreds of other features they don't care about

solid logic"
CurlyJeff,"The refresh rate is the most noticeable aspect of a phone, especially once someone's gotten used to a higher rate they can't go back. There'd be a good portion of people for which it's the only ""pro feature"" they care about."
TommiH,"BS. They are doing that so there's a step between the models. They make the cheaper one worse on purpose. ""Pro has a better screen"" is a pretty good way to separate them. Also only a blind person can't immediately tell that the 120Hz just looks better."
Trisentriom,"While this is true, the standard iPhone customer would definitely care more about 120hz than 70% of the features mentioned today"
James_Vowles,what is this logic
InsaneNinja,Some geeks are thrifty.
Iammattieee,"My friend got an iPhone 13 Pro Max and I asked her what she thought of the 120hz pro motion and she looked at me like I had two heads. I showed her the difference between 60 and 120 and she told me she didn‚Äôt see a difference üòÖ. Can‚Äôt tell if she was trolling or didn‚Äôt care.  I asked why she got the 13 pro max and she said because of the larger size it offered. 

This was before the iPhone 14 launch but it just shows people don‚Äôt care about refresh rate"
habirton,"> The customer who wants a standard iPhone experience doesn‚Äôt care about refresh rate. Apple knows that any customer looking for a higher refresh rate will automatically migrate to the pro model.

Absolutely! I'm a programmer and a gamer. I work on a gaming laptop with a 144hz display, yet I'm more than happy with my basic iPhone SE. It has the latest version of iOS, home button with Touch ID, 5G connectivity, A15 chip and it was $430 unlocked without a carrier contract or lock-in.

I'm not a professional photographer, nor do I take that many photos/videos anyway. The cameras on it work just fine for my needs.

Lastly, I have roughly 16GB free out of the 64GB which includes all the photos videos I took in the last 8+ years, all of my recent podcasts, a few TV shows, a couple of movies and whatever people sent me in messaging applications.

When they refresh to A16/A17 and implement USB-C in 2-3 years I'll probably consider upgrading then, but I'm more than happy with what I have until then."
samcuu,"They don't care because they don't know any better, because they never get to experience it. It's a feedback loop."
valacious,"I agree, but i am on the fence now about not having a pro model phone because all the feature i want are on the 15, but the kicker is it does not have that refresh rate, which is disappointing."
KingPumper69,"It‚Äôs actually going to make me migrate down to the iPhone SE 4 when that eventually comes out (assuming it has an oled screen), so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a one way street to the pro models.

If I‚Äôm not getting (barely) premium features at $800 I might as well drop down and pay the least amount possible. Better camera? üò¥. 10% faster CPU? üò¥."
smmoke,Once you use a high refresh rate screen (be it laptop or phone or whatever) you will care about it and you can't go back. And its 2023 they should give higher refresh rate on base models too. Even the cheap Androids have minimum of 90hz display these days.
williamwzl,Apple is a premium brand. They should be stepping up to deliver a premium experience regardless of what we think a customer cares about. There is no tradeoff for a VRR 120hz capable screen.
ConfusedIlluminati,"Fixed it:

Apple knows that it can sell whatever at 800$ price point, with not a single premium feature."
nugget_lover_,It feels cheap to leave out a feature that budget android phones had in 2019 for $800.
,Hooray for anti-consumer behavior
punkidow,Most 120hz phones do have an option to switch to 60hz if you really care about the extra battery life. Though im not sure how much of a difference it even makes. Has anyone run any tests to document the difference?
,"All phones that have 120hz let you toggle down to 60hz optionally and via battery saving mode. My phone battery lasts well over a day regardless, so 120hz would just be all positives."
drwert,USB2 speed on an ¬£800 phone in 2023 is just hilarious. Wireless file transfer will probably be faster on a good network.
ReagenLamborghini,"iPhone 15 uses last years A16 Bionic SOC which doesn't have the circuitry for USB 3 speeds. I don't think the average iPhone user transfers data over a wired connection often or at all anymore so the reality is most people won't really care or notice. 

People who really do need or want the faster USB 3 speeds can get the iPhone 15 Pro. Hopefully next year the iPhone 16 will get this years A17 Pro chip which does have circuitry for faster speeds."
crazysoup23,Not for that price.
yaboyfriendisadork,Not on an $800 phone
TwoTermBiden,"After you experience 120hz it's hard to go back. I'll be hanging onto my 13 Pro until they pry it from my cold dead hands, or until it no longer has iOS support, lol."
Kalahan7,"‚Ç¨970 price tag ain't ""fine"" though lol. 

Seriously, many Android phones of half the market are rocking a 120hz display. 

Keep defending Apple on this like it's OK to ask premium prices yet not deliver premium quality."
Mrsharr,60 hz on an 800 dollar phone is not lol
Prestigious-Tap1554,"but i am certain many people care about battery life and promotion increases it because it can throttle the refresh rate down. Most time/things people do on phone is/are static screen frames, so it increases battery"
SlackerAccount2,"Because your graphing calculator doesn‚Äôt have GPS, modem, graphics card, 17 other significantly harder things to do things to do. Did you really think you have a point?"

techackpro123,Ok just making sure my stream isn't like 2 minutes behind.
jcmriar,"They should probably go to a 2 year cycle, no S versions in between."
PotPyee,Best way to make money. Apple is no longer focusing on innovation but on stability because that‚Äôs what sells
throwmefuckingaway,Steve Jobs did a great disservice to humanity by passing away so soon üòî
justhere4thiss,"Wait, the camera of the normal one is the same as the pro?"
raze464,It is accurate since various Apple products have had USB-C for years but isn't the 12-inch MacBook from 2015?
jojoko,2012
rtyoda,Apple was one of the first computer manufacturers to add USB-C to their laptops. In fact they were heavily criticized when they came out with the MacBook Air that only had USB-C as no one was using it back then and it basically required a dongle to be useful for most people. Now people act like Apple‚Äôs never had a USB-C device before. How ironic.
rnarkus,How is it stupid when it is technically accurate?
36840327,Red will probably come in the March event

Consistent_Purple501,"That's not the point

People who are migrating from Android will 10000% notice and care lol

And when you say 99% of iPhone owners it's only those who haven't ever gotten the pro models for the past phones

They should've atleast used a 90hz display..."
WhoDat-2-8-3,I just asked  all the iphone users  and 99.9999 % says they care
Gallagger,"You're wrong. 120hz is one of the main selling points of the Pro. Without that, I bet a siginificantly higher % would chose the base model (lower profit margin) over the pro.

It's greedy marketing, ""torturing"" (exaggerating..) all these base model users with 60hz just to get some % to switch to the pro."
FightOnForUsc,Also a 3x or 5x telephoto and titanium rails which should be more sturdy.
exomniac,Sweet
Dr-McLuvin,Which is honestly all I really care about. The screens have looked great ever since they switched to AMOLED or whatever it‚Äôs called.

very_smol,"Same. I‚Äôll only upgrade my iPhone once my AirPods die, then I can toss all my lightning cables away üòÇ"
nothingexceptfor,"I didn't say it wasn't clever or maybe useful, what I said is that it is a marketing wonder, just the fact they named it, and named it ""Dynamic Island"" which invokes so many things other than just a clever way to show notifications is amazing to me, and then keep mentioning it everywhere, forefront as if it was an actual big feature."
Ok-Fox966,"Because budget android phones have been 90hz+ for years now, there is no excuse for apple to not be using it"
Cushions,Why wouldn't you? You interact with it incredibly often that it just feels nice.
,"Extremely smooth, next time you walk into a phone store use one of the phones on display that have a 120hz screen, once you get used to a 120hz phone after using it for a few days, going back down to 60hz feels like trash."

ace_master,Aperture is bigger on the base 15 (f/1.6 vs f/1.78) but not sure if it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.
JustWastingTimeAgain,"It's not about the price, it's about the waste.  For Apple to charge the same for an adapter as a new cable is effectively telling users to throw their old cables in the landfill instead of re-using them.  Their messaging is wildly inconsistent."
JustWastingTimeAgain,"I am talking about availability in the store, not what's included.  I have a ton of lightning cables.  Would be nice to just get adapters for them at a reasonable price instead of all new cables and having to toss the old ones."

SUPER_COCAINE,"I just want one fucking charging cable that can work across the vast majority of the devices. My MacBook charges with USB-C, my iPad, USB-C, my iPhone lightning, my AirPods lightning. Just give me one universal charger so I can find something different to complain about."
Coridoras,I think you are mixing up USB micro with USB C. USB C you can connect both ways as well
Broccoli--Enthusiast,"yeah but when everything else you own has usb c, its just a pain in the dick having this 2nd cable just for the one device, throwing my 65w laptop charger in my bag and being confident it can charge all my things is great, same with not keeping 2 cables in the car.

sure its a first world problem, but apple were the literal last holdout here when everyone else got with the program."
indianajoes,You say lightning doesn't care which way up it goes like USB-C doesn't do that as well. Plus it's even better because you can USB-C to USB-C cables and plug either end into the phone
DangerIsMyUsername,fuck the lightning cable
WigginIII,I‚Äôll admit though that apple‚Äôs usb connections on their iMacs feel way more secure than other manufacturer‚Äôs laptops. They have a satisfying click. Meanwhile Lenovo and Dell laptops the usb c connection is loose and doesn‚Äôt inspire confidence. I expect the same for the iPhone.
stan11003,"As someone with kids, no the Lightning connector is not durable."
donkeyrocket,"USB-C is all of that plus standardizing the cable I need to carry around. Now just my Airpods and Watch have a dedicated cord and they can share it at least.

nerdymen242424,That‚Äôs nice to hear! Will defs be upgrading to the base 15 from my se2020. The value proposition seems decent aside from the no 120hz
Chrisgpresents,"I just checked for th 14 pro on apple's website.... looks like it's completely discontinued now? Maybe can get a new one in store. Is there a 13 pro? Maybe Best Buy carries it or something for less, wondering if thats a step down in any major way."
Josh_Butterballs,May as well never get excited for anything then since chances are someone else did it first
Someone_Somewhere1,and still took worse photos and dont get me started on the video.
NateHurst2187,Pretty sure the S23 Ultra has the new 208MP camera too. Apple still takes great photos don't get me wrong but acting like this is revolutionary is dumb
luxmesa,And that could be a concern for some customers. My mom needs a new phone and I was telling her about the 15. She‚Äôs leaning towards the 14 mostly to avoid buying new cables.

ewaters46,"It‚Äôs not. Apple can‚Äôt lock faster speeds behind their own cables, but there are Android phones with 2.0 ports too."
Tratix,Is it?
irridisregardless,Elaborate plz
Emergency-Spinach-50,It's huge for content creators. Especially being able to record video directly to external media and use some external devices you couldn't before. People don't realize what media creation powerhouses modern smartphones are and this will be a huge unlock for tons of use cases.
TheClimor,"But if most people aren't going to use it anyway, why invest the effort, time and money into this feature instead of something else that makes the users happy, like better cameras or more durable design? If majority of customers of this particular device model don't care about cable transfer speeds because it's not something they utilize, why should Apple put the effort to make it happen?"
Samuelodan,"Nah! I sent a few items today via cable and it took so many minutes that I went to eat while it was running.

It‚Äôd have been near instant with a USB 3 Android from years ago."
_Rand_,"I‚Äôve literally never plugged my phone in for data transfer and I‚Äôd bet Apple has data showing most don‚Äôt like you say.

It‚Äôs important to some people sure, but Apple doesn‚Äôt really make a thing say 5% of users want a priority.

It‚Äôs unfortunate of course, because it‚Äôs a pretty basic thing really.  Presumably 10g usb 3 will be on all  iPhone 16 models though, like the island is now with the base model getting it."
996forever,Then using the same logic they used an ‚Äúabsolutely useless feature to the overwhelming majority of people‚Äù to headline an upper end model.
,But I demand the fastest possible everything for no particular reason!
B9F2FF,Why is USB C 3.0 then in Pro version if no one cares?
L0nz,"Considering the s23u internal storage caps out at 4.2gbps, there's no benefit to having 10gbps usb speeds.

The galaxy and note series have been 5gbps since the Note 7 way back in 2016, so there's no excuse for not having at least 5gb on the base iPhone 15 in 2023"
James_Vowles,"ah I see, so as long as they have the same charging speeds"
Mnawab,"If I may, does it matter? Like 10gb transfer speeds is pretty fast. Unless I‚Äôm missing something. Unless we are talking about straight gen 2 usb in which case apples sucks but it‚Äôs not the end of the world. Just wait next year I guess."
James_Vowles,"iphone 16, the law comes in middle of 2024 I believe"
Mnawab,But we all know why apple did it now and it‚Äôs because of the EU.
EgalitarianCrusader,"Pretty much. I had to upgrade my Series 5 Apple Watch to an Ultra earlier this year to still have access to calls and texts if my phone dies.

With the birth of my new daughter and my crappy battery I‚Äôm half considering upgrading to a 15 Pro Max for battery life and Spacial Video to record memories."
infamousbach,Well there has to be some incentive for the Pros
Professional-Dish324,"I think if you‚Äôve used a pro-motion display for any length of time, you can‚Äôt go back. 

Conversely, if you haven‚Äôt you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing, so you don‚Äôt care.

At least that‚Äôs what Apple is likely betting on."
wolahipirate,"before apple added pro motion to their phones id always complain about how aandroids are better because iphone screens only ran at 60hz. all my iphone friends kept saying ""no one needs that, regular people cant notice a diffference"".  


Now apple uses that feature as their MAIN product segmentation incentive for the iphone lineup. looks like alota people were able to notice the difference"
VoidMageZero,Dynamic Island will eventually become an iPhone SE only feature once they finally move FaceID under the display in a few years and get rid of the notch.
HalfViking14,Is the 15 plus better than the 14 pro max? Or are they basically the same now?
UndercoverChef69,Why are we pretending that we need 120hz or more on our phones?
Spaghetto23,"Good luck, it must be scraping by /s"
Real_life_Zelda,I‚Äôm holding onto my 13 mini because there‚Äôs no new mini again. Sadge
deadshots,"i think this is the right move (i have the 13p myself). usb-c is obviously early and potentially.. the iphone16 could have thunderbolt next year

along with potentially better spatial recording for vision pro (they are introducing this with the 15p, but we don't know how good that actually is)"
Reesepect,The pros have ProMotion which has a variable refresh rate of 1hz to 120hz depending on what you are doing. Only the pros (13 Pro and above) have a high refresh rate. The regular iPhones are capped at 60hz refresh rate.
hijoshh,"Ah but pro is 120, got it. Interesting they don‚Äôt highlight that fact anymore"
The_OtherDouche,I have a 11 pro max and miss my 7 a lot. I really did not like this iPhone. Camera looks fantastic though
WWWWWVWWWWWWWWVWWWWW,"I'm using a 7 and it's objectively better than any phone made in 2023 in almost every way.

Thinner, portable, one-handed, no ridiculous photo over-processing, no notch, home button to easily unlock your phone before it's even out of your pocket, touchid + faceid if using jailbroken tweak, metal back so it doesn't shatter when you drop it, easily replaceable, far more stable iOS version than 16 or 17, long animations able to be turned off using jailbroken tweak saving an hour of wait time every week."
the_wang,I mean u/benediktleb basically just did lol
benediktleb,In what way?
Parallel-Quality,They do have variable refresh rate from 1hz to 120hz.
StopwatchGod,"All Pros since the 13 Pro have 120Hz and Variable refresh rate, the 13 Pro went down to 10Hz and the 14/15 Pro go down to 1Hz for Always-On Display."
ForShotgun,Pretty sure? I guess I really only cared on the MacBook Pro
madn3ss795,"There's measurable difference, and that's due to the use of [PWM](https://www.oled-info.com/pulse-width-modulation-pwm-oled-displays) for brightness control. The PWM frequency on base iPhones are [very low](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-iPhone-14-smartphone-review-Small-upgrades-for-the-Apple-phone.661760.0.html) (60Hz), sensitive eyes will see the display flickering, this can cause eye strains from prolonged use. The [Pro models](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-iPhone-14-Pro-review-The-Apple-smartphone-is-ready-for-the-island.659550.0.html), and [S23 from across the pond](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-S23-review-The-small-S23-smartphone-makes-the-biggest-leap.700018.0.html), while still utilizing PWM has 4x the frequency, so your eyes are much less likely to recognize it."
ForShotgun,"Sure there, there are flashes in my eyeballs"
axxionkamen,Yep! There are 2 big noticeable jumps in refresh rates. The first is going from 30-60hz and it‚Äôs noticeable immediately. The next one is 60-120hz but isn‚Äôt nearly as big as 30-60hz. After 120hz is been shown that you‚Äôre are diminishing returns category and gets worse the higher you go there after.
ecs2,I'm using a 90hz budget android and I'm going to replace it with the new 15
Vaptor-,I've been using 144hz display since 2012 and I honestly don't mind 60hz on phones.
rangorn,The human eye can‚Äôt really notice any higher then something like 23 hz. Maybe it makes a difference in how responsive it feels when tapping and swiping etc.

twicerighthand,"Wdym ""Allow Apple to adopt it"" ? 

You haven't read the document, have you ? 
You don't know it's up to the USB consortium (companies) to decide what common port to use, do you ?"
Prince_Uncharming,"Airpod pros will start coming with USB-c as well. Your apple watch already had its own charging pod anyways.

Now you can charge your ipad, macbook, iphone, and anything else modern with the same cable."
markca,They are making it sound like they are doing it out of the kindness of their heart and not because of the EU.
vk136,"But look at apple now, they‚Äôve brought back MagSafe, HDMI and other ports back to the MacBook Air lol"
Aaawkward,"> I mean everywhere except phones apple has been essentially leading the pack on USB-C so its basically true. 

I see you don't use Airpods. Or an Apple Watch."
SacRepublicFan,"Having worked at AppleCare when iPads switched to USB-C, yes there were a lot of vocal customers who preferred to continue with Lightning and felt duped that they had a device with a different port. A lot of customers out there like using the plethora of cables they‚Äôve accumulated. Do you remember when cellphones first came out and nearly every model used a different charger? Thats why Apple made a long commitment, to assure customers they would get longevity out of their accessories."
,">Think about it. iPads moved. Macs moved. iPhones didn‚Äôt.

I need you to think about all of this real hard. A lot harder than you already have. Because it very obviously and very clearly disputes the point you think you're making.

>You can try to cope

It's not cope. I am stating objective facts. *You* are coping and seething because you think I'm defending a company you want to criticize, when all I'm actually doing is correcting a fact.

>and say it‚Äôs because of the 10 year commitment but then I ask you is it any better that Apple committed to a port on a phone for over 5 years when there were far better alternatives?

USB-C was not ready when Apple wanted to drop the old 30-pin connector, that's the only reason why they developed Lightning. Apple is one of the biggest forces behind USB-C, it's weird to think they somehow have a problem with the concept. The 10 year commitment was specifically a result of their users and their accessory partners complaining that dropping the 30-pin connector left them with a lot of useless products.

This isn't a debate, dude, and you don't have to be so mad and so argumentative about it. I believe in you and I know you can listen to these facts and leave this conversation a bit smarter than you were."
lolKhamul,"exactly. People still refuse to believe it but its just clear at this point that apple bet on the wrong horse in terms of connector which is why were were stuck on lightning this long.

Their plan 5-8 years ago was to be without a connector at this point which is why they never made an effort to change the iphone to usbc or put the plan into motion. But as well all know, wireless charging speed and efficiency didn't evolve fast enough. Lightning got more outdated every year but they stuck to it because why do something they actually dont want to. Now their hand was forced which is why its here."
InsaneNinja,The rumors about the 15 having USB-C came out when the iPhone 13 was about to come out
,The fanboys are the people falsely claiming Apple only did this because of the EU. **THE EU'S REGULATIONS ARE NOT EVEN IN EFFECT YET.** It's astonishing how stupid you sound.
SuperMazziveH3r0,"They got the 48mp main sensor, 14pro SoC and dynamic island.

Honestly the only thing that sways me away is 60hz and USB 2.0. 90hz would've probably convinced me to get a 15 instead of 15 pro

Don't really care for the titanium, don't really need 5x optical zoom (had an S22 Ultra briefly and the 10x optical zoom was a neat party trick and that's about it), don't need ray tracing on my phone

15 is basically a 14pro without a 120hz and AOD"
,"Yep, I was in a similar situation to you in regards to upgrading. I had a crappy xiaomi phone (still had 90hz display too) but wanted to upgrade and get the iPhone 14 as I haven't used an Apple product since 2015 and wanted to try something new. But was shocked to learn the screen was still 60hz lol, I would've even accepted a 90hz screen aswell but 60hz is just... no, in 2023 on a phone that costs 1k where I'm at? noooo way. Ended up getting the new galaxy s23 and I'm happy with it. 

Was considering waiting until the iPhone 15 because I was certain they would at least put a higher refresh rate panel on it but I thought wrong, quite disappointed, but also glad I didn't waste my time waiting. Guess I'll stay with this phone for another 2 or 3 years and hopefully by then, all new iPhones will have a 120hz display."
jupitersaturn,Thats just what happens as technology improves vs. when its early in the innovation cycle.
SorryNotSorry_78,I have an iPhone 7 and 8+ and they work great
LeakySkylight,"Thanks, I'd forgotten.

I'd kind of wished they keped up with the # - #s naming.  The 15 is definately the 14s."

AvgGuy100,"I've never used cable to transfer files from this iPhone since I bought it. Now I remember it correctly, I've never even used cable to transfer anything from my old Galaxy A51 as well. Always just uploaded it to the cloud.

I wonder who in what job stores such huge files on their phone to warrant file transfer speeds."
lachlanhunt,"They added a new USB controller to the A17 Pro to support USB 3. Since they were always going to use the A16 in the iPhone 15, it‚Äôs more likely a technical limitation of being stuck on last year‚Äôs SoC. We‚Äôll have to see what happens next year when the iPhone 16 gets the A17."
goshin2568,I mean I agree but it's not really penny pinching. They're using the A16 for the 15 which has a USB2 controller on it. So they'd have to upgrade all the 15s to A17 which is a bit more than pennies.
cylindrical_,"> USB 2 is ancient and no product should be shipping with t

The vast majority of users aren‚Äôt going to care about the USB 2 transfer speed - which means that it absolutely should be shipping with USB 2 transfer speeds. That's what ""should"" means here. Additionally, I think you're not factoring in the A16 chip."

Forsaken-Humor-1476,Yea the navy is pretty nice
VinniTheP00h,"Eh, I still consider iPhone 12's blue color to be the best."
Carrera718,"Man, the iPhone 13 line had the best colors. The blue, green and red were stunning and the other colors weren‚Äôt necessarily boring, they looked great on the phones. I remember being upset at how the 14‚Äôs colors were less vibrant, but the 15‚Äôs colors make those look oversaturated in comparison lol"
PNF2187,"If it's any sort of consolation, the FineWoven cases for the 15 lineup are available in Pacific Blue for some reason. But yeah, not a fan of the regular 15's blue either. It's already an incredibly pale blue, and the frosted glass kind of works against it here by making the colour even more washed out."
c0mptar2000,I think eventually they will have to upgrade. Already embarrassing that the pixel 7a has 90hz for $500 along with every other flagship for the last 5 years or so. I'm sure they will milk the 60hz displays for as long as possible tho to entice ppl to get the pro models who don't really need the cameras.
ElPlatanaso2,tHe hUmAN eYE cAnt sEe pAsSeD 60hZ
ocbaker,I‚Äôm the same. I can just tell the difference below 60 but I have an M32UC and M28U right now to each other with only the M32UC at 144hz (thunderbolt bandwidth cap) and honestly‚Ä¶ absolutely can‚Äôt tell the difference. Maybe if I started pixel peeping but in my everyday usage I absolutely can‚Äôt tell.
warbeforepeace,Wait till you hear that the iphone can even go down to 1 hz refresh rate for battery life.
LX47001,That wasn‚Äôt the point of my comment. People who know what this stuff means might be able to tell. But a huge majority of people have no idea what any of it means and even having it pointed out to them in real time either can‚Äôt tell or don‚Äôt care.
jpeZJKvT2j9z84,"I am probably one of those geeks in that I am a SWE and follow this subreddit and I could not give less of a fuck about 120hz iphone.

TheAspiringFarmer,"that's true. i'd argue they don't really care about any of the ""Pro"" stuff. they just want the new iPhone and go about their daily routines. Apple has made a fortune on this customer and the gravy train appears to be pretty solid indeed."
Likancic,It doesnt matter its still 800 dollars lol
MewTech,Still no excuse to have a 60Hz display on an $800 phone
gyang333,"I swear, I remember people complaining about refresh rate when the 12 came out, but I didn't notice anything going from the iPhone 11 Pro to iPhone 12, since both were 60 Hz.  I also didn't notice anything going from the iPhone 12 to the iPhone 13 Pro with the increased refresh rate.  But after about a year of using the 13 Pro, and using a 12 again, I noticed the difference.

So in short, people who have never experienced more than 60 Hz will never know, until they go to a higher rate and then try to move back."
smmoke,And the sheeps will have everything to defend forever.
EpicShinx,What is this weird complacency logic? The average person can't tell the difference between A14 and A16 so they shouldn't keep improving their processors?

noisymime,"I agree that 99% of people will have no idea what you're talking about if you say it to them, but those same people absolutely notice the difference if you give them 2 devices, one with and one without a higher refresh screen. 

They don't know what it is, but I've heard people comment about how much smoother one feels that the other. Often they think it's that one phone is more powerful because things look nicer when scrolling etc."
yupyupyupyupyupy,"its such a terrible excuse...and one they got incredibly wrong

they should say the typical base iphone user does not know they want x feature...and even then like i said, its a terrible excuse"
voiceOfThePoople,"Have you ever used your phone in the cold and you can see that the refresh rate has lowered?

Going from 120 to 60 feels like that. Granted, what you don‚Äôt know won‚Äôt hurt you, but it‚Äôs a real ‚Äúcan‚Äôt go back‚Äù situation once you do cross over"
Manburpig,And that's why you happily pay a premium price for base model type stuff.
,[deleted]
finnytom,"From a business perspective it makes a ton of sense. For people that don't know what refresh rate is/and or don't care about it, meaning the VAST majority of apple customers, it doesn't matter.

For people that care about that sort of thing, Apple charges more for that. They're offering different phones for different type of people, and charging more money when they can. I doubt it would cost Apple much $ to add in ProMotion to the regular models, but why would they when they can make money using that as a feature for the Pro iPhones?

Of course this isn't desirable for the consumer, but like all other Fortune 500 companies, Apple isn't a pro-consumer company."
,"It's not an excuse, it's a reason. 99% of iPhone customers don't give two shits about refresh rate, why would they spend the money to add it?"
EpicShinx,"By their lame logic Apple should just keep using A14 since the average person can't tell the difference. Lower the ppi of their displays while they're at it. Imagine going against people who want more for their money.

marcocom,"I think it‚Äôs nice to have the price option for those who don‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôm really not sure outside of gaming, that you‚Äôre seeing much of an effect with 120hz really."
AllModsRLosers,"It explains the business case. You can think it sucks, but Apple is a business and doesn‚Äôt care about anything except money.   

This move makes them the most money.  

Your part in the dance is to look at what‚Äôs on offer and decide whether you‚Äôll pay for the Pro upgrade, get the standard 15, hold off for a year or switch to a competitor."
sophisticateddoodles,"And 60hz is fine for 99 percent of standard iPhone users. If they made the standard iPhone high refresh, they‚Äôd see a drastic drop in sales of the pro model."
jimmyjxmes,"it is tho, as a company why would you spend more money on something you know that customer base doesnt want? lol"

TheAspiringFarmer,"shush. putting a 120Hz panel on a lot of those Androids is a total waste and nothing but marketing. it's the modern day equivalent of selling the consumer a 5-plus year old GPU with a shiny new name and slapping 1TB of VRAM on it...the average person will believe they have the best, with no understanding that all that VRAM is a complete waste and the card cannot utilize it."

But over time, more and more devices are using USB-C. My 2 work laptops + personal laptop all do usb-c. My ear buds, keyboard and mouse all use it to charge. 

It's so easy to travel with 1-3 cables now because they all use usb-c. It's Apple's fault for holding out so long. They probably still would if not for the EU.

With that said, Apple could do a trade in program that offers discounts (if buying a new phone), if they really cared about the environment (want the good PR)."
,"Ah understood! I initially misread!

That said though when the day comes when my entire house has USB devices we‚Äôll be tossing all our old lightning cables rather than buying adapters to continue using our existing cables."
USFederalReserve,"I get where you're coming from, but if Apple were to produce adapters for a cable that they're dropping support for on their flagship product, that would be antithetical to their goal of being carbon neutral. 

Plus Apple likes outsourcing the lightning cable to 3rd party manufactures. It reduces their carbon footprint at the company level, it cuts out the cost of manufacturing, and they get to charge royalties to the 3rd party manufacturers."
EraYaN,AliExpress will full fill that demand super super quick I assume. Like 1.25 $ adapters everywhere and some might even be decent at that price.
CentreForAnts,Haha yeah good point. Make adaptors cheap af. Wear the cost so people don't have to throw away their current cables and chargers. Or even include it in the box for free.. it's still USB 2.0 speeds so nothing really has changed except for the connector.

I have plenty of USB C devices and to all intents and purposes, the standardisation (of the socket at least - capabilities of different USB cables/ports varies still) is a huge step forward that I welcome. That said, lightening still has a place in my heart as it was just a design that stood the test of time so well. I also have to give credit to Apple for shunning micro USB when every other manufacturer was adopting it - that really was a diabolical design that rightfully deserved to die quickly."
kelp_forests,"the one thing I dont like about USB-C is the flimsy connector inside and the inability to tell what cable/port does what, how much data/power it can carry, and if the connection will work. I feel like I am just connecting stuff and expecting it to work. hopefully they get a little symbol setup or something.

For example some cables carry 40w some 60w. Some USBC ports are PD, some aren't. My hard drive can connect to my iPhone, but will it do anything? will it draw power? I dont know."
iJacobes,fuck the USB-C cable
aleximoso,"Yeah - agreed. I bet Apple actually put time into details like this in the way that premium car companies put time into getting the right ‚Äúclick‚Äù and weighting on buttons and dials in the cabin/dashboard. Probably way more so than most other companies as well, given that they‚Äôre not short on resources to dedicate to all the small details."
DangerousAd1731,"It isn't great but it's been better than the Nintendo switches and Hp laptops with usbc dock stations. 

To replace the port on a switch, costs almost as much as a used switch cause of all the tiny prongs I found out. Hopefully apples take is a small board with ribbon cable to main board to fix faulty ports."
motram,Since you understand technology so well... tell me the use-case of data transfer via cable for the average iPhone user.
motram,"They aren't insulting people.  They, unlike you, understand that real people that actually use (base model) phones don't care about wired transfer speeds.  

They understand that using last years chip saves them millions, and the people that (for some stupid reason) want to do professional photography and videography on their iPhones can buy the pro models"
MrSh0wtime3,wow you are right.   Do they always remove pro models?  Dont remember.   But they have to I guess since the phones dont change much at all year to year.
PugsAndHugs95,"Pixel line put out dirt cheap phones that went toe to toe on photos, video was at least as good as the basic iPhone models, of course iPhone Pros still dominated the video performance and quality. 

It's okay to respect the competition. Sometimes Android phones do hardware or software things that forces Apple to innovate and that's good."

cougar572,We all know it‚Äôs going to be put into the 16 to make it look like an upgrade. The cost to put it in is negligible at apple‚Äôs scale and they had to change design stuff anyways to implement usb c so it could have been done at the same time. It‚Äôs just typical apple stuff intentionally gimping things to make other products and future ones look better in comparison.
cylindrical_,I bet it's *way* below 5%. I bet it's less than a percent of people that desire > USB2 speeds. Just my blind speculation though.
zachy_bee,Maybe if iPhones had integrated file management system you would actually want to use it as a portable 512GB SSD. Guess apple hsers literally can't complain about features they don't know exist.
cylindrical_,"Yes, they always use the high end models to subsidize the more widely used phones."
cylindrical_,There's a reason why you have to twist my words to make your point. I didn't say no one cares. Use the word I *actually* used and I think your question will answer itself.

audigex,"It doesn‚Äôt even require the same charging speeds

The only requirement is that the device can be charged with USB-C

There‚Äôs nothing about data transfers or even that it must *only* be charged by USB-C - Technically they could have included Lightning as well and limited USB-C charging to 0.1W or something absurd like that"
__theoneandonly,"Nope, October 2024. Which means the iPhone 16 will have already been released and will be grandfathered into the old laws."
__theoneandonly,"When apple released lightning, they said ""this will be the standard for the next 10 years."" And then on the 11th anniversary of that promise, they switch to USB-C.

Which do you think is more likely? They promised their customers and shareholders a port a standard that would exist for 10 years, and they kept that promise down to the week of its 11th anniversary... or they decided to carve to legislative pressures two years early?"
Gigachad__Supreme,Bro I swear to god the 'Pro' model line is the stupidest ass shit you ever saw - they should have stuck with the regular iPhone and iPhone Plus naming scheme
Altruistic_Grand_455,They could've atleast chipped in a 90Hz display for the non pro models.

NotJohnDarnielle,"They were pretty obviously going to be making this switch already, but they promised 10 years of Lightning when it came out, and that was in 2012.

_ravenclaw,The MacBook Air does not have hdmi or other ports
USFederalReserve,"Yeah, Apple bet big on manufactures of accessories and PC laptops going as hard as they were on USB-C, but it did not come to fruition. 

I'll be honest though, I was fine with the USB-C as all of the ports, what ruined for me on those early macbooks was the overly thin body and the USB-C port's durability. All of the ports on my 2017 macbook except for 1 is only partially functional and a big reason for that is accidental tugs on the AC power cord causing wear on the USB-C port."
goshin2568,Airpods are a companion device for the iPhone. Obviously they're going to keep it on the same charging cable. And apple watches wireless charge so not really sure what your point is there.
devappliance,"> Having worked at AppleCare when iPads switched to USB-C, yes there were a lot of vocal customers who preferred to continue with Lightning and felt duped that they had a device with a different port.

Sounds like this could have been solved with Apple switching all devices to USBC at same time.

Also, Apple could include adaptors to ease customers into the transition if they wanted to. But they didn‚Äôt ."
Rydorion,">Thats why Apple made a long commitment, to assure customers they would get longevity out of their accessories.

And not using the world wide standard like usb, because they wanted to milk their customers. You worked for AppleCare so you know that to be true.

They screwed themselves by calling it ProMotion, making people believe it‚Äôs a Pro feature."
stupid_horse,"I feel like 90hz would be a good compromise for the non-pro phones, where it would allow them to better compete with Android phones which offer high refresh screens on phones costing half the price of the regular 15 but still have a differentiation from the 120hz pro phones."
seamus_mc,Bootlicker because they dont care about refresh rate?  Do you people just use that term for anybody that disagrees with you?  The word is meaningless anymore.
EpicShinx,You experience 120Hz more using the phone doing daily tasks than in gaming. Scrolling and animations becomes extremely smooth in apps.
TheBirdOfFire,"a $100 budget android phone would be fine for 99% of people, but that's a terrible excuse for an $800 smartphone in 2023. There are $200 Android phones with 120hz displays and they will feel noticably smoother than the upcoming iPhone 15. It's not like it would be too expensive to implement to create a better product. It's just for segmentation."
Blaze4G,It's fine because they don't know better. I am sure 99 percent of standard iPhone users will be fine with the A15 chip...so you don't think Apple should have upgraded that either right?

Sounds like they need better stuff to differentiate the models if we go by your argument of decreased sales for such a simple feature.

Withholding almost 5 year old industry standard tech from their customers for arbitrary reasons is bad. If that's the deciding factor then the pro is not good enough, or they're not confident enough with the rest of the differentiators"
EchoSolo,Don‚Äôt bring logic here.
ArgoMium,"120hz display phones start at around 400$. There is no excuse for apple to have flagship pricing and entry level phone specs. An iPhone should not have any spec that is worse than a 400$ phone's spec. Flagship phones even have variable refresh rate, a feature that lets the phone go down from 120+hz to 10hz to save battery life, depending on what you're doing (reading, watching videos, static screen). It's a feature they're gonna release down the line and pull the classic ""All new feature on an iPhone!"" (that has been available on most other phones for 4 years now)"
DrunkPimp,"They really won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just like the 120Hz display- Apple can keep artificially gimping the transfer speeds and the only people that notice or care will be buying the pro phone anyway.

I don‚Äôt agree with them gimping it, however literally 99% of people airdrop or access their stuff via the cloud anyways. People back up via iCloud, and so people rarely connect their phone to mac/PC to hardware back up anymore.

I like to do backups to external SSD for photos just in case for some reason my iCloud data shits the bed, but it‚Äôs a very niche/minority case. Someone filming enough content to regularly save time via USB 3 transfer is also a minority case"

Are you sure that anyone over the age of 16 worries about this?"
Kichigai,We've had fast charging before USB-C was a thing.
Broccoli--Enthusiast,"that doesnt make it ok, the fact its taken them this long to ditch usb 2 speeds at all is a joke."
Ok-Fox966,That doesn‚Äôt excuse them still using USB2 in 2023. I thought apple was meant to be innovative
masklinn,"I would not be so sure. 

The iPad mini has usb 3 on an A15. The iPad Air only has 10Gb despite using the same desktop class SoC as the previous generation Pro, which supported 40."
L0nz,Then explain why the 5 year old iPad pro using an A12 has usb 3 gen 2
ArdiMaster,Cheap USB thumb drives can barely maintain those speeds for a few seconds because their crappy flash chips can‚Äôt keep up.
TheClimor,"I don't know what the consideration was to not having that in.  
However, if someone's using this for data transfer, that means they have heavy content to transfer, meaning it's probably extremely high quality video or photographs, and that person really isn't going to get a 15, they'd get the pro because they'd get much more for it.  
I don't think a lot of people actually transfer massive amounts of GBs from their phone and back via cable that it really makes sense to add that in if you're not creating content, and I'm also not aware of any Android phones that have USB3.0 transfer speeds, but I could be wrong."
Outlulz,And maybe if it wasn't using USB 2.0 speeds. Apple has trained it's users that wired connections with their phones are awful. No wonder no one does it.
996forever,"Be more direct. 

Are you agreeing that they actively market useless features for high end models?"
L0nz,"That's a sweeping generalisation.

Photos and videos are bigger than ever, airdrop is unreliable, barely any faster than USB2 and not available on PCs. Even if only a small percentage of people ever use it, we're talking about a basic feature that's been on the market for several years. I'm still amazed that people happily excuse Apple for excluding basic features on a $800-900 device."
Mnawab,bro if that was the case they wouldn't have been so upset with the EU about enforcing usbc. it has nothing to do with apple making a 10 year promise. also the standard for the next 10 years doesnt mean they will change it up after 10 years. All that means is this will last at least 10 years. they changed up their ipad pro usb but still kept everything else lighting so if that was the case apple would have made everthing usbc back then.
masklinn,"Plus is for the larger size. Pro is for additional features. 

Pro Max is what‚Äôs dumb (it‚Äôs the large version of the Pro, so it should be either Max or Pro Plus). 

Then again the entire modern Apple naming scheme is shit. On macs you have the M2, the M2 Pro, the M2 Max, and the M2 Ultra, which is above the max because ???  And pretty much all they are is larger combinations of the same base modules."
JhnWyclf,"‚ÄúPlus‚Äù isn‚Äôt as ego stroking as ‚Äúpro‚Äù. They focus tested it. ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù gives folks a semi while ‚Äúpro‚Äù makes one, ‚Äú I can only get so hard.‚Äù

Figure it out. üôÇ"
Mnawab,Ya but from a business standpoint it‚Äôs a dumb idea. People are going to buy iPhone regardless so why would apple ever do something that nice? Being nice only hurts profitability.
WigginIII,"If Apple enabled the option for 120hz but didn‚Äôt specifically notify the user or have it on by default, I would wager 90% would remain at 60hz. 

These are iPhone users. Their phones are fashionable appliances."
tjfrank94,It‚Äôs not that noticeable most users wouldn‚Äôt care.
sudopm,"Yup, why on earth would you pay $800 for an iphone 15 when you could get a brand new s23 for $680 which has a 120hz screen, telephoto camera, etc.  


The $800 model is legitimately a SCAM"
wolahipirate,well they brought the 14 pro's camera down to the 15 model. sounds like 2nd priority to me
HalfViking14,I believe the 15 plus is 60hz. I‚Äôd like to buy one of them and the 120hz is the only thing swaying me towards the 14 pro max.
legopego5142,"People are buying it regardless, why cut into profits like that?"
Dr-McLuvin,I agree it just makes for a smoother experience. I suspect the reason is mostly due to the hit to battery life.
tkim91321,"lmfao what?

A panel does not die faster because it has a higher refresh rate.... Stop it with your nonsense...

The fact that a flagship iPhone doesn't have a high refresh display is a fucking disgrace in 2023."
996forever,Then explain why they put a worse feature according to you onto the pro models?
deadshots,it's the paid off part that really seals the deal for me too lol
xelIent,"the 13 pro and 14 pro both have 120hz, so you might want to consider one of those as well"
benediktleb,"Oh that's good to know. We got a ten month old now and we need good photos of them of course, but so far i was happy with what the 12PM produces. But maybe once I compare..."
Cushions,"Blergh, just tried it on my P6P and it's night and day difference in smoothness."
Kichigai,Well the filibuster is kind of a problem.
ZetZet,"Europeans are not basing their privacy on trust, they are basing it on fear. Meta or Apple would both get blasted if private data leaked or was used inappropriately so it doesn't matter which one you use.


And the apps are based on convenience, messenger is used because everyone had Facebook and WhatsApp used mobile numbers so it was easy to get into. Some people use Viber too."
neutronstar_kilonova,"Because the world's and Europe's 70% population uses Android, i.e. no access to imessage. The world is bigger than the blue v green bubble bullcrap sold by apple to its fanatics."
Curun,"Everyone data on open systems available to every advertising engine.  
Nope no thanks corporate shill"
SUPRVLLAN,Definitely Apple then.
Prince_Uncharming,"Sure, but that‚Äôs a shortcoming of Apple‚Äôs wireless charging. Not a downside of migrating from lightning to the ubiquitous usbc."
Luised2094,it just so happens they did it the year before they would have been legally requerided to
USFederalReserve,I think they meant Macbook Pro
darthsurfer,"I think it was less about others not going as hard on usb c, than it was about people and apple realizing how inconvinient it is to carry around dongles over having the most commonly used ports be built in.  

The magsafe being the biggest removal for me. Im just glad they brought it back on the new macbooks before I had to get a new one."
Aaawkward,"Mostly just that not everything except phones is USB-C when it comes to Apple.

Besides, Airpods are just much a ""companion"" for laptops and tablets as they are for the phones."
SacRepublicFan,"If they transitioned early, people like you would have called them liars for reneging on their 10 year lightning commitment and/or called it a money grab to make people get new accessories. If they include adapters then that creates e-waste for anyone who doesn‚Äôt need the adapter and the EU would make some law punishing them for that. You can go back and look at when Apple moved-on from 30-pin. People were upset even though lightning was better in every way. People like you are just perpetually mining salt."
SacRepublicFan,"If they were ‚Äúmilking customers‚Äù why change the iPads years ago? They didn‚Äôt make a commitment to lightning on iPads but they did on iPhones. They also could have released another model year of iPhones with lighting this year to continue ‚Äúmilking‚Äù customers before they need to be compliant, but they didn‚Äôt, they switched the year the 10 year promise expired.
Also if the EU is so worried about customer protections, why dont they target EU companies like BMW that are innovating things like heated seat subscriptions. That seems more anti-consumer than an alternate charging port."
,"No, Trump, that's not how real life works. You can't just ""believe what you want"" when it comes to facts.

It is objectively true that Apple committed to using Lightning on the iPhone for 10 years.

It is objectively true that this 10 year period ended this year.

It is objectively true that Apple has already migrated almost their entire product line to USB-C prior to the iPhone adopting it as well.

It is objectively true that the EU's USB-C regulations do not apply to this year's products.

If you know all those facts, you cannot conclude that they're only making this change because they're forced to."
InsaneNinja,"Last minute?  The deadline is Christmas 2024.  The iPhone 16 could legally have been lightning phones, and been sold that way for their entire lifespan. 

This port change came this year because this is the standard ‚Äúthree-year body‚Äù update."
SuperMazziveH3r0,"You could say that going back to iPhone 2g

Why get a 14 when you can get a 13 pro

Why get a 13 when you can get a 12 pro

Why get 12 when you can get a 11 pro

Why get a 11 when you can get a XS"
LeakySkylight,There's a patch for that...
Br0lynator,"Thank you!!!

I don‚Äôt get why people like big smartphones! Like if you want to game are watch stuff - get the iPad! The iPhone is for communication and I want this to be as small and thin as possible! I am so sad that I missed the 13 mini but at that point my SE was to new to even consider it‚Ä¶

Edit: A iPhone 15 mini with USB-C would be perfect!"
jilko,"I consider myself the opposite of wealthy also and have dropped my caseless iPhone 12 more times than I can count. Onto concrete, asphalt, tile, into the deep ends of pools. Just recently, my phone slid off of the top bunk in a Refugio and it hit the tile floor and its impact basically woke everyone up in the room. Phone still has not shattered. Still looks basically new. Ever since the Ceramic Shield, the new phones are way more durable.

So there‚Äôs no purpose to covering your phone in all this after market crap, hiding it from view and just making it bulkier and allowing dirt to build up in all the added gaps and creases.

Cases and screen protectors are now a grift. Unless you‚Äôre a construction worker or prone to decking your phone at the ground out of rage, you really don‚Äôt need all the extra plastic shit adhered to your phone anymore."
RealisticCommentsBOT,Apple Care is for the rich.
Tom_Stevens617,">overpriced cloud storage

It's a dollar a month for 50 extra gigs. What's fairly price in your opinion lol"
AvgGuy100,"IDK, I just use Google for storage. Never really thought about it. It's cheap and most digital data I'd need or want to share is mostly on the web anyway these days, except for maybe family photos and videos."
cylindrical_,"I think you're overestimating just how few people actually use data transfer over USB on their iPhones. I don't believe the number of people is that low with things like the A16 chip. There is a significant amount of highly tech savvy people that will indeed utilize the A16 chip. There are a lot of devs, sysadmins, pentesters, ML/AI people out there that will use the A16 chip. Take this with a grain of salt, because it's an anecdote: I know several people in all of those fields and none of them use the port for anything other than charging - All will most likely utilize the A16 chip."
alfredcool1,Yee just turn on low battery mode and you can feel the 60hz instantly. I can‚Äôt go back now lol
Dr-McLuvin,"Very true for video games. 120hz is like a night and day difference. Everything feels silky smooth. 

IMO prob not necessary for a phone screen but it would be nice and it would be very noticeable."
Hoobleton,Pacific Blue is the best iPhone colour there‚Äôs ever been.
ocbaker,Like staring at the screen to purposefully spot the difference
EnesEffUU,"I'd argue most people do nothing that even necessitates a new iPhone at all. Why draw the line at 60hz vs 120hz. No reason not to have 90hz at least on a $800 phone. If we are just going by what's necessary, there doesn't need to be a new iPhone at all."
ArgoMium,"Unless you daily a phone with a high refresh rate display, you really won't understand why people are pushing for high refresh rate displays on phones."
TheAspiringFarmer,"no idea. i do know that Apple makes a killing on both, however. it certainly wouldn't surprise me."
EpicShinx,"They don't complain about it because they haven't experienced better...

It's okay if you love complacency :)"
linkedlist,"Again it's not about the average user or whatever, it's all about maximising profits."
deekster_caddy,Whoops I thought they started with the 12. My bad.
deekster_caddy,Whoops I thought they started with the 12. My bad.
finnytom,"Who knows. My guess is that it's most likely to compete with the Samsungs abnormally large MP size, and Apple probably determined through consumer research that MP size is a much larger defining factor for purchasing rather than display hz. You can easily compare MP size between phones, but not 120hz to ProMotion.

Adding onto this, Apple **rarely** uses the term ""hz"" when marketing their phones, they only say the display has ProMotion. For your grandma comparing Samsung and Apple, Samsung might say 120hz display but Apple says ProMotion. Which one do you think makes more sense to purchase, based off the naming alone?

I'd bet my left AirPod that Apple found that ""ProMotion"" makes more sense, sounds more desirable, and comes with the trust that consumers place in Apple for their consistently good features. Thus, is the reason why it's put in their Pro phones and not regular lineup. Feature marketing is a huge factor that Apple has on lock and likely contributes to them segregating features such as this."
EraYaN,Probably for that cropped telephoto thing without the extra lens.
Narwhalbaconguy,"Because the average person wants better photos, not refresh rate"
TheAspiringFarmer,"because a bigger number looks better on marketing especially against the absurd MP of the Android devices these days. even though we know it doesn't matter (it's all in the post-processing and software, not the camera sensors or optics) the average Joe doesn't understand that. all he knows is his friend has a 48MP or 50MP on whatever shiny new Android and so he has to be there too."
loozerr,Could be that they'll recoup sensor costs because of volume.
leo-g,They did 48mp so that they can do one more zoom without another lens. That‚Äôs already amazing for most people.
EpicShinx,Even if you don't care about it doesn't mean you should be against people who want more for their money. That's why it's bootlicking because theyre caring more for the company's interests.
motram,"Ehhhhh


It's fine. 

Most people don't even notice it."

Aarondo99,"I own a 14 Pro and a 13 Mini, the 120Hz is nice but it just isn‚Äôt a deal breaker"

PigeroniPepperoni,Wait until you hear about places outside the US.
USFederalReserve,"> They are producing the adapters .

Oh shit, are these new? I thought they already had this product line, but I could be wrong! 

> My point is that the adapter pricing being the same as a cable will cause consumers to toss their old cables entirely, ensuring more trash in the landfill. Now as to who is producing them, I have no idea, but the pricing is messed up when you look at all the greenwashing they just threw at us.

I agree with the first part of your statement, but I don't agree with the characterization of the greenwashing. Apple made their carbon neutral by 2023 announcement at the turn of the decade and for all intents and purposes, they're steadily moving towards that goal. 

I don't think the EU forcing them to either drop all EU customers or change their hardware is antithetical to that goal. 

I think Apple is stuck between a rock and a hard place. They don't want to welcome the EU legislation by fully supporting a pivot because it'll make them a playable pawn, but they also don't want to push so much of the burden on to the consumer that they appear as though they're maliciously complying."
CentreForAnts,Yeah true. I'd say they made it the same price so people are like. Mays well just get the new USB C cable and charger then. I'm half way there.
TommiH,What was phone charging? iPhone had it's own connector while many other brands used USB
motram,"Okay, you are wrong.  People don't use it for that.  Wifi sync works.  No one is transferring songs from their computer MP3 collection to their iPhone anymore.

jmnugent,"I don't expect you to know this.. but can I order an iPhone 15 fully unlocked and just pick it up in Apple Store (I live near an Apple Store now !) .. I'm an AT&T customer so my existing iPhone 11 is my main phone number. I was hoping I could just buy an IPhone 15 in person and just swap the SIM (or somehow transfer to eSIM). 

I don't want to order from AT&T.. because the only thing they'll do is ""ship to my house"".. which I don't trust (have had to many packages stolen :( .. so I'd rather just buy the iPhone 15 (pay in full).. and if I have to carry it in person to the ATT Store to have them transfer my number ?

Powerful_Loan_5836,"It‚Äôs funny because Bono even talks about it in his autobiography. Basically apologizing and says that‚Äôs not how the band intended for things to play out. To be fair, it‚Äôs definitely not their fault whatsoever. Apple could have literally done anything to fix it"

selwayfalls,99% of our problems are first world bullshit. Everyone should chill
selwayfalls,"I think biologically most of the things we choose to do are about being attractive to the opposite sex / keeping our genes going in the gene pool. We do it subconsciously a lot of the time. The clothes we wear, what car we drive, where we live, our hobbies, how we act/show up on social media,. Apple is a sexy brand, their marketing is the best in the world - airpods make you X percent more attractive, making music, making art, and editing videos on an iPad is 'cool' and attractive to a lot of people. A phone maybe less as there are so many to choose from now, but for a long time an iPhone was actually exciting to people. Owning apple products makes us think/are we're more creative, and actually somewhat more attractive, etc. I'm not just making this up, it's proven in research. Obviously this isn't everyone but a generalization of brands. Brands are powerful. I'm probably just slightly more aware of it as I work in design and advertising and Apple has always been the standard for producing creative work."
bluesquare2543,can you give an example?
ClarkZuckerberg,"I don‚Äôt know a single person who has transferred data on their iPhone via cable in years. The reality is the average consumer will never use this feature, and the people who will use it are people who will likely buy the Pro anyways. Not an excuse, but an explanation."

InvaderDJ,"For so long I‚Äôve wanted Apple to simplify on iPhone XX and iPhone XX Pro. Or even IPhone YEAR and IPhone Pro YEAR. Different sizes don‚Äôt need different names, people know whether they want the big one or the small one and how to select the size they want."

LLlMIT,"You've reached the right guy, I used to work as a Mobile Sales Advisor for Best Buy. 

Once you buy it unlocked and set up the iPhone, it'll ask you to transfer your SIM card to the eSIM of the new phone (granted, you're doing a full transfer) This setup should be done automatically by the iPhone, as they will do the carrier contact and transfer by itself. 

You shouldn't need to go to a store to get situated. And if you have issues come launch, come back to this comment and reply or DM me. :)

The 15's will not have a SIM card slot in the US. So the eSIM transfer will be necessary."
ModdedDreams,"This can all be done very easily! You can buy the phone unlocked and if you plan on trading in your old phone make sure you erase it! Then you can contact AT&T support and ask for your number to be added as an ESIM to your new phone. They will most likely ask for some numbers from your new phone, and then ESIM will be setup!"
LeakySkylight,LOL that is very cool to hear. They could have just put a button in iTunes or something ...

blackashi,they also don't make it easy lol. I detest itunes
seahorsejoe,that‚Äôs because no one would make it known that they tried transferring files. I have tried transferring data from my 14 Pro via cable and gave up once I realized how slow it was.

L0nz,"Again you're assuming that every non-pro iPhone user is a non-techie.

You don't have to look far on here or on r/iphonehelp to see plenty of people having issues transferring a large number of photos or video over airdrop, it's fine for small stuff but not for the kind of things you'd want USB3 for."

Malady17,I‚Äôve used both Samsung and Apple on and off for years. At the end of the day they‚Äôre both phones. They are 95% the same thing. If there wasn‚Äôt such a social stigma in America on using Android phones I would undoubtedly still have a Samsung.
Major_Dick,"So you were a Pixel fan, the brand with a shit ton of QA issues, but disliked Samsung? Makes sense."

ksj,"Like the 30-pin connector used on the iPod and iPhone? I‚Äôm really not sure what you‚Äôre getting at. They all used similar proprietary connectors, but everyone moved to Mini-USB in the mid 2000s, then Micro-USB, and eventually USB-C while Apple stuck with the 30-pin until 2012 when they introduced Lightning."

jmnugent,"Thanks appreciate this !.. I've transferred eSIM to eSIM before (with the new way of just ""Hold the 2 iPhones near each other"".. which was pretty slick !.. I just remember (especially with corporate managed phones) that old legacy SIM to eSIM was a bit more cumbersome. 

I guess the nice thing in this type of situation .. is my phone-number continues to work on the old phone (I'm in no rush to wipe or sell the old phone)

My ATT account actually has 2 iPhones on it (w/ 2 independent numbers).. since I do MDM (Mobile Device Management) for a living. So I think I have some duplication and fallbacks there if something goes sideways."
,"iTunes went away on MacOS a few years ago, I feel bad for windows users still stuck with it"
axxionkamen,"I mean you‚Äôre not wrong however, if it is hardware limitation then that‚Äôs on Apple to figure out. They could just dump the A17 into the generic iPhone 15 too and call it a day while still not losing not even a penny. But we know Apple and how they operate. 

Same thing can be said for the 120hz display. It‚Äôs technically behind a paywall. In this day and age there‚Äôs no reason the standard iPhone should be limited to 60hz. Even a sub 200$ android phones offer 90hz. And yet only the pro models that are over 1k offer higher hz display which is to say it‚Äôs behind a literally paywall lol. 

This is fully my opinion and I know not everyone agrees with it."
__theoneandonly,"‚Ä¶ when did they say that??

I think they offered some valid concerns about how the EU will evaluate the successor to USB-C, and the EU made adjustments to the law in response to that. But once their concern was addressed they didn‚Äôt really respond to the law at all, other than changing the port on their phones."
EgalitarianCrusader,Problem is the Pro line is siphoning features away from the regular iPhone.
Dr-McLuvin,"If they only had the pro model, i don‚Äôt think they would sell nearly as many phones overall. Makes sense to have a cheaper version for those who don‚Äôt need all the bells and whistles. 

Kind of like saying Mercedes Benz should only sell the S class. They would be giving up a ton of market share."
MenacingDonutz,"Never said you couldn't voice an opinion, just pointed out you made an assumption about the wants of millions of Apple customers without any evidence to support your claim."
tjfrank94,"I have a sheep NPC opinion? I didn‚Äôt even state an opinion, yet you‚Äôve deemed it a sheep NPC one. Hilarious. 

I didn‚Äôt say you couldn‚Äôt dislike iPhone/Apple. Calling a new phone a scam because it doesn‚Äôt meet your standards is just a simple exaggeration. No one is forcing anyone to buy an iPhone 15. There‚Äôs no trick or deception, so it‚Äôs not a scam. 

You like Samsung. Congrats. All I was saying is that you‚Äôre not going to get much discourse and agreement in an Apple sub on the day the new devices are announced."

Kep0a,"cool man I'm saying USB3.0 is the standard, it has been for years, apple should be shipping with it, that's really it"
loozerr,"Stability and consistency? How's that at odds with higher refresh rate? If anything, app dropping a frame is less of a deal (17ms vs. 8ms until next frame) leading to better consistency.

I scroll a lot, and lowered delay from touching to something happening is very noticable.

Battery saver kicking in and forcing 60Hz is night and day."
IDENTITETEN,"Which is irrelevant because updates don't work the same on the two platforms. 

There's a ton of update stuff handled by the Play Store services for example and you don't need a full system update just to update system apps like you do on iOS for some reason."
Major_Dick,">They are 95% the same thing.

Yep, I can tell a lot of people here either used shitty Androids or not at all. Apple has a bit more polish, Samsung has a bit more features. Everything else is pretty much the same. Easy to avoid getting locked into either ecosystem."
sic_erat_scriptum,lol you purchase phones based on perceived social stigma
sic_erat_scriptum,It does indeed make sense if you aren‚Äôt a simpleton.
Regular_Ship2073,"Not what i want, it‚Äôs the trade in value. I‚Äôll keep with my 11 pro for another 2 years at least"
LLlMIT,Make sure for 2FA you transfer those to the new phone first before resetting the old one. I recommend using Google's newer 2FA since it's cloud based and not device based.
Meeesh-,"I agree that they can do it, but it‚Äôs not like it wouldn‚Äôt cost them anything. They sell a lot of iphones. Hundreds of millions. $1 saved means hundreds of millions of $ saved.

It‚Äôs something to consider still as a company and they made a choice. Especially for the chip, I wouldn‚Äôt say they could drop in the A17 into the 15 for no cost. They literally bought all of TSMCs supply for 3nm technology. Even if it costs more money I‚Äôm not sure if anyone would be able to make enough for Apple in time.

Maybe with your definition of paywall you could argue about the display, but certainly not about the chip."
Mnawab,"Their concern was ‚Äú regulations can drive conformity across the different types connectors built into all smart phones and can freeze innovation rather than encourage it. Such proposals are bad for the environment and unnecessarily disruptive for our customers‚Äù. 
anyone can read that and say apple doesn‚Äôt want it. If they were going to put usbC into the iPhone they wouldn‚Äôt have even addressed this. Companies always have some shit to say when they start getting regulated. Apple probably wanted to avoid usbC all together and go port less but got blind sighted by the EU. Again if apple really wanted to embrace usbC for their iPhones they would have done it when they started putting usbC into their iPad pros. The fact that they didn‚Äôt until now plus their statement only proves it was the EU that made them implement usbC into their iPhones even more. Whether they did it ahead of schedule doesn‚Äôt really matter."
ZemGuse,I doubt they would sell the base iPhone for $799 with all the pro features
tjfrank94,Why do I need evidence to just say what I think?

Nearly every iPhone user in the world disagrees with you on this. But certainly it's not you that's wrong - it's the entire rest of the world, right?"

You aren't getting things done faster.   Loading is the exact same.

jmnugent,"Dang!. glad you reminded me of that too. I have some older SMS codes,. and I have about 10 accounts setup in Microsoft Authenticator (my preferred as a lot of the work I do is Microsoft Azure based). 

I also bought 2 x Yubikeys a year or so ago (the 5ci version that is both Lightning and USB-C).. so that should work no problem if the new iPhone is USB-C. I've used my Yubikey recently to setup a new MacBook Pro and authorize my AppleID and it worked smooth as could be. 

A lot to think about these days for Security :P"
axxionkamen,"And in the same argument you‚Äôre using can be said about the display lol. The new display on the pro is and AMOLED 120hz. Ofc business it doesn‚Äôt make sense to drop the A17 into the regular 15 because then people wouldn‚Äôt care to spend the ridiculous asking price for the pro models. And so my point still stands that the better hardware is locked behind a paywall. 

As I previously stated. Apple won‚Äôt do any of that because we know how they operate. They are extremely anti consumer and they are just as bad if not worse than Nintendo at screwing their customers and at the end of the day we all just eat it up. I‚Äôm guilty of it. Up until the iPhone 12 I was upgrading every year. Still have my 12 pro Max and isn‚Äôt going anywhere at this point. USBC it‚Äôs enough for me to care to upgrade at the moment. Been considering going back to Samsung and trying out android again For the first time in 10 years. The fold 5 really has been tempting me lol"
EgalitarianCrusader,I‚Äôd argue that we would have had a 120 Hz screen by now if we only had iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.
MenacingDonutz,"You claimed nobody wants 120Hz in the base phones, I merely pointed out that you don't have evidence for that. It was a claim, not an opinion."
tjfrank94,"Lmao that‚Äôs not an opinion it‚Äôs a fact, son! Sorry you hate iPhones so much, you‚Äôll grow up one day. You‚Äôre so hateful over phone preference. [That‚Äôs my whole point.](https://reddit.com/r/iphone/s/VTargf3hCn)

LLlMIT,"I gotta get me one of those. My YouTube was recently hacked, and I need more security like that. And I like more keys to jangle on my lanyard"
Meeesh-,"Honestly I don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre trying to have a open discussion because it really doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre even reading my comments. If you don‚Äôt want to buy it then don‚Äôt buy it.

Apple may be anti consumer, but this is not the example of it. They are very clear about what they‚Äôre selling. There is no misdirection, no stopping people from doing things with what they buy. Are you going to call your local mom and pop bakery for being anti consumer because they charge more for a chocolate crossiant than a regular crossiant?"
ZemGuse,Would it be $799 though?
tjfrank94,I didn‚Äôt say NOBODY wants 120hz. I said ‚Äúmost [base iPhone users] wouldn‚Äôt care‚Äù if there phone is locked at 60hz.

motram,"If you think that going from 60Hz to 120Hz saves you time, you are just mistaken."
Major_Dick,"It's mostly just the fact that your experience was like using a $500 Windows laptop, complaining that Windows sucks, and switching to a $1000 Mac because it's so much better.

Full story here if you need some afternoon reading: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/oi4b31/_/h4t9dek/?context=1

So..yeah.. since then I've tried to be more diligent about ""redundancy"". The Yubikey solution works pretty great,. although I just moved cross-country to a new city where I don't know anyone. So currently I don't really have any ""human fall-back option"" in case some emergency happens to me. 

I do have a Rugged waterproof USB .. so I'm thinking of figuring out some way to hang a packet of information (or a small ""In case of emergency"" box right inside my front door.. so on the off chance anyone has to ""break the glass"", they can read a note of instructions, have some House and Car keys and info about my online accounts). Still thinking this one through to find the right approach."
EgalitarianCrusader,I‚Äôm not sure. There are plenty of smartphones with 120Hz at a lower price point. It‚Äôs not like it would have every single Pro feature.
